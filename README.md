# mock-up-full-page
On this exercise we have to achieve a mock up full page, taking into the consideration that must be responsive. 

Objectives: 

So today’s assignment is also  a mock up for a full webpage this should be in repo on github and also github pages.
-you have to consider this website is very responsive 
-you can  take some hamburger menu ideas from codepen, only if you totally understand what in it, or you can Build  your own one
-keep this file for tomorrow’s project we will continue
-i provides all the pictures and the background for this Assignment

Main struggles:

-Set the correct order of the items in HTML and then edit them with their respectives relevances on css (and make them work).
-Set the background image. (Never ever under * but always body) so won't be absolute. 
-Color the buttons - because I have set the backgound-image in the wrong place!
-Distribuition of the different items on the page.
-And of course, make it responsive! As if all the previous details are wrong...no good results can come here! 

I am satisfied about:
-The result is getting closer to the exercise requested, but still there is a huge room for improvement.
